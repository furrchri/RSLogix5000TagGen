Program needs .csv, .L5X, files with the names given in the repo already to modify and edit. Note that the program will add tags to existing csv document or start from 
Row 0 if document is blank/empty. If you would like to change the module specifications of your VFD template, export a new module with the name "template" after 
configuring device with desired drive rating, IP address, etc.
